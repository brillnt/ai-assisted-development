# AI Assistant Initialization Prompts

A collection of battle-tested initialization prompts for working with AI coding assistants. These prompts implement systematic methodologies to prevent AI eagerness and ensure high-quality, verified code development.

## Philosophy

AI assistants have a fundamental tendency toward over-eagerness - rushing to implement solutions, adding unrequested features, and claiming completion without verification. This repository provides initialization prompts that channel this eagerness into productive, verified progress through systematic human-AI collaboration.

**Core Principle: "Measure Twice, Cut Once"**

## How to Use

### For Browser-Based AI Assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

1. **Start a new conversation**
2. **Copy and paste the entire `01-initialization` prompt** (comprehensive or condensed based on preference)
3. **Wait for the AI's acknowledgment**
4. **Copy and paste the appropriate `02-` prompt** for your specific task
5. **Provide your project details** where indicated in the Step 2 prompt

### For IDE-Based AI Assistants (Cursor, Cody, Copilot Chat, etc.)

1. **Start a new session**
2. **Copy and paste the appropriate initialization prompt**
3. **Follow with your task-specific prompt**

## Key Features

### Universal Principles
All prompts implement eight universal principles:
1. Permission-Based Action
2. Evidence Over Assertions
3. Systematic Progression Through Living Documentation
4. Transparent Limitations
5. Critical Thinking Over Agreement
6. Quality Through Review Layers
7. No Time Estimates
8. Collaboration Over Completion

### Multi-Step Initialization
- **Step 1**: Establishes working principles and prevents eagerness
- **Step 2**: Introduces specific task with appropriate constraints

### Investigation-Focused Debugging
Instead of "fixing" problems, the AI investigates systematically to understand issues before proposing changes.

### Living Game Plans
Every project begins with a detailed game plan that serves as the single source of truth throughout development.

## Prompt Types

### Browser-Based Assistants
- **Comprehensive**: Full principles and detailed workflow (~1500 words)
- **Condensed**: Essential principles and workflow (~500 words)

### Step 2 Variants
- **New Project**: Starting from scratch with full planning
- **Analyze Codebase**: Understanding existing code before modifications
- **Refactor Existing**: Systematic improvement of working code
- **Debug Investigation**: Scientific approach to troubleshooting

## Best Practices

1. **Always use Step 1 first** - Never skip initialization
2. **One task at a time** - Complete projects systematically
3. **Verify everything** - The human verifies, the AI suggests
4. **Update game plans** - Mark progress and learnings
5. **Investigate, don't fix** - Understand problems before solving

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Jumping straight to task description without initialization
- ❌ Asking AI to "fix" problems (triggers eagerness)
- ❌ Proceeding without verification
- ❌ Accepting time estimates from AI
- ❌ Skipping the game plan phase

## Contributing
